# php-copy-file-from-server
Copy a file, server-to-server instead of downloading and uploading.

Have you ever been faced with having to donload a HUGE file, only to need to upload it to your own server?

Ug ... Fear not, this script will save you serious time and bandwidth.

It copies the file from the destination web server directly to your own server, no download or upload required.

Ahhh, that is better ...

1) Upload this file to a folder on your web server.
2) Open it in your web browser.
3) Enter the complete remote URLto the file in the form's input.
4) Set the file name you want to download.
5) Set the local folder to download to, relative to your home dir.
4) The file will be quickly transfered from the remote server to yours.

Need to PUSH a file to another server? Try my php-ftp-file-away script.
